/*METHOD 3 (A Juggling Algorithm) 
This is an extension of method 2. Instead of moving one by one, divide the array in different sets 
where number of sets is equal to GCD of n and d and move the elements within sets. 
If GCD is 1 as is for the above example array (n = 7 and d =2), then elements will be moved within one set only, we just start with temp = arr[0] and keep moving arr[I+d] to 
arr[I] and finally store temp at the right place.
Here is an example for n =12 and d = 3. GCD is 3 and 


 

Let arr[] be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}


a) Elements are first moved in first set â€“ (See below 
   diagram for this movement)


          arr[] after this step --> {4 2 3 7 5 6 10 8 9 1 11 12}

b)    Then in second set.
          arr[] after this step --> {4 5 3 7 8 6 10 11 9 1 2 12}

c)    Finally in third set.
          arr[] after this step --> {4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3}
